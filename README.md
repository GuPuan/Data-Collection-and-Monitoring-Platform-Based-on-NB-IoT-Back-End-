# Data-Collection-and-Monitoring-Platform-Based-on-NB-IoT
This project is my graduation design based on Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT). Using the Vue and SpringBoot frameworks, I developed an online platform that can monitor in real-time the data collected by sensors supporting NB-IoT technology, such as temperature, humidity, and pressure.
